## Installation

### PowerShell Script

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\packaging\install.ps1
```

Installs `wstrace.exe` to `$HOME\.local\bin` and registers the directory into the User `PATH` environment variable.

### Windows Package Manager (Winget)

```cmd
winget install gilnett.wstrace
```

### Scoop

```cmd
scoop install packaging/scoop/wstrace.json
```

### Cargo (From Source)

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

### Prebuilt Binary

Compile directly using the Rust toolchain:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The resulting standalone executable is located at `target\release\wstrace.exe`.

---

## Usage Guide

### Verification

Confirm that `wstrace` is accessible in the current shell:

```bash
wstrace --version
```

---

### Interactive TUI Mode

Launches the target application with a real-time event table:

```bash
wstrace run <executable_path> [-- <arguments>...]
```

#### TUI Keyboard Controls

| Key | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Ctrl+C` | **Copy Selected** | Copies the highlighted event details into the Windows clipboard. |
| `Ctrl+A` | **Copy All** | Copies all currently filtered events into the Windows clipboard. |
| `Ctrl+E` / `Space` | **Pause / Resume** | Freezes the event view without dropping incoming telemetry. |
| `Ctrl+X` | **Clear Buffer** | Empties the current event list from the display buffer. |
| `Tab` | **Category Cycle** | Filters events: `ALL` -> `FILE` -> `REG` -> `NET` -> `PROC`. |
| `f` | **Failures Only** | Restricts view to failed operations (e.g. access denied, not found). |
| `Up` / `Down` | **Navigation** | Selects an event for deep inspection. |
| `q` / `Esc` | **Exit** | Terminates the tracing session cleanly. |

---

### Attach to Running Process

Attach to an existing process by Process Identifier (PID) or binary name without restarting it:

```bash
# Attach by PID
wstrace attach -p <PID>

# Attach by process executable name
wstrace attach -n <process_name.exe>
```

---

### Child Process Tracking (`-C` / `--children`)

Tracks the target process and recursively monitors all child processes spawned by it:

```bash
wstrace -C run <executable_path> [-- <arguments>...]
```

---

### Path Filtering (`--include` and `--exclude`)

Isolate relevant operations or suppress operating system noise:

```bash
# Include only operations matching a substring
wstrace --include "<substring>" run <executable_path>

# Exclude operations matching a substring
wstrace --exclude "<substring>" run <executable_path>
```

---

### Headless Stream Mode (`-m stream`)

Writes live events directly to stdout with ANSI color codes for logging or CI/CD pipelines:

```bash
wstrace -m stream [-d <seconds>] run <executable_path>
```

---

### Structured JSON Export (`--export-json`)

Exports all captured session events to a formatted JSON file upon termination:

```bash
wstrace --export-json <output_file.json> run <executable_path>
```

---

### Clipboard Export (`--copy` / `--to-clipboard`)

Automatically copies all captured session events directly to the Windows clipboard upon exit:

```bash
wstrace --copy run <executable_path>
```

---

## Enterprise Compliance & Institutional Governance

`wstrace` is engineered to meet strict institutional requirements for deployment in high-security enterprise environments (banking, defense, healthcare, and critical infrastructure):

### 1. Zero Cloud Data Leakage (Air-Gapped & Sovereign)
`wstrace` is 100% offline and standalone. It maintains zero remote servers, initiates zero telemetry or analytics, and performs zero outbound network calls. Any sensitive data observed during live tracing (API tokens, file paths, credentials, memory contents) remains strictly confined to local RAM and never leaves the workstation.

### 2. Zero Kernel Drivers (Zero Ring-0 Footprint)
Unlike traditional tracing utilities that install third-party `.sys` kernel drivers—introducing system crash risks (Blue Screen of Death / BSOD) and ring-0 backdoor attack surfaces—`wstrace` operates with zero kernel drivers. It relies exclusively on non-invasive userland Win32 debugging and native Windows Kernel ETW consumer interfaces.

### 3. Strict Local Access Control & Session Isolation
Trace telemetry is strictly bounded by the Windows user session and Mandatory Integrity Control (MIC) boundaries. Unprivileged user sessions cannot access or inspect higher-integrity processes without explicit administrator elevation, adhering strictly to the principle of least privilege.

### 4. Regulatory & Standard Alignment
- **SOC 2 Type II & ISO/IEC 27001 Alignment:** Complete data sovereignty, zero external data egress, and auditable build provenance.
- **GDPR (RGPD) & CCPA Compliance:** *Privacy by Design* architecture. Zero personal data collection, profiling, tracking, or commercialization.
- **EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) Readiness:** Documented security disclosure policy ([SECURITY.md](.github/SECURITY.md)), automated CVE dependency scanning via Dependabot, and third-party license audit inventory ([THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md](THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md)).
- **OWASP Rule #1 Compliance:** Zero hardcoded secrets, credentials, or private API keys across the codebase and version control history.
